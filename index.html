                You can try out your raw input ability using this test I made. Just type all the correct keys in order! Of course, you only have 2 seconds to do it successfully. 
                If you fail, just press the button again!
                <br> <br> I've kept the keys used down to a select few often used in games: W, A, S, D, E, F, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
                Please note: This will only work with a keyboard, not on mobile.
